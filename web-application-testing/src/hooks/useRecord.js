### Count Rules

- balls and strikes reset to 0 when a player reaches 3 strikes or 4 balls.
- balls and strikes reset to 0 when a `hit` is recorded.
- a `foul` increases strikes up to 2. With no strikes, a foul makes 
  it 1 strike. With 1 strike, a foul makes it 2 strikes. With two strikes 
  a foul has no effect, count stays at 2 strikes.
